## Administrative rules

1. The goal of the game is to have fun. Anything that would cause misery, pain, suffering, etc., to other players is against the rules and the spirit of the game and is a  sanctionable offence.
2. If you, at your own will, agree to participate in this game of tag and are registered as a player, you agree to follow the rules as described in this document.
3. Your registration can, at any given time, be terminated, either by requesting it or by putting it to a popular vote. After that, you have to register again to play.
4. In order to apply, you first have to be invited by a registered player, and your application is to be put to a popular vote.
5. Every player can submit a suggestion for a change in the rules. This can be done by opening a **pull request** containing the desired change in the rulebook. These changes are to be recorded under **3. Amendments** section.
6. As the author of this document, I reserve the right to settle ties and make changes to the rules until another arrangement is made.

## Basic rules of tag

1. To tag a player, you need to physically touch a part of their body so that they feel it and announce that they have been tagged.
2. After being tagged, there is a cooldown of 30 minutes during which the player who got tagged **(p2)** can not pass the tag back to the player who tagged him **(p1)**. If the tag gets passed to any other player, for example, a third player **(p3)**, **p1** is fair game, but **p2** is not.
3. There are no safe zones. No matter where a player is or what he is doing, he can be tagged as long as his safety is not endangered and it won't bring harm, misery, etc. to others.
