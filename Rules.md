## Basic rules

1. To tag a player you need to physically
   touch a part of their body so that they
   feel it and announce that they have been
   tagged.
2. After being tagged there is a cooldown
   of 30 minutes during which the player that
   got tagged (p2) can not pass the tag back
   to the
   player who tagged him (p1). If the tag gets
   passed to any other player for example a third player (p3)
   p1 is fair game.
